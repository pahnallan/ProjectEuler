# Problem 4
# Largest palindrome product
# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
# 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
